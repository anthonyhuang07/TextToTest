# TextToTest

## About

TextToTest was made solo by Anthony Huang in 2023 for the Hack the Ridge Hackathon at Iroquois Ridge High School. The theme was Education Innovation.

TextToTest is a website that creates a quiz for you out of questions and answers that you input with Markdown input. Written in HTML, CSS and JS.

Quiz makers usually require you to enter multiple answers to one question, and require a convoluted UI to create these quizzes. TextToTest makes this all text based, while matching answers to the questions for you.

## How to Use

TextToTest follows Markdown syntax.

\# creates a title, which you must put on the first line. ## creates a question. Regular text makes an answer. You should follow a question with an answer on a new line.

If you'd like to add extra fake answers, please add them at the end of everything. There must also be a minimum of 4 questions and 4 answers.

Example:
\# Quiz
\## How many minutes is in 1 hour?
60 minutes
